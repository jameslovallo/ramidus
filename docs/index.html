# Ramidus Docs

Ramidus is a SPA framework built with, and designed for, custom elements.

## Table of Contents

- <spa-link href="#getting-started">Getting Started</spa-link>
- <spa-link href="#project-structure">Project Structure</spa-link>
- <spa-link href="#pages">Pages</spa-link>
- <spa-link href="#layouts">Layouts</spa-link>
- [Components]()
- [Deployment]()

## Getting Started

Setup is easy and no tooling is required. You can scaffold your project using `npx` or simply download [this zip file](https://codeload.github.com/jameslovallo/ramidus/zip/refs/heads/main).

```sh
npx ramidus@latest && npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

The "@" folder contains everything relevant to your application like components, assets and layouts. "@" is short for "app." This convention keeps the app folder first alphabetically so you don't lose it in your content.

<div class="tree">

<span><img src="/@/assets/folder-home.svg">@</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/folder-assets.svg">assets</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/folder-components.svg">components</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/folder-css.svg">css</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/file-js.svg">build.js</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/file-js.svg">main.js</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/file-json.svg">head.json</span>

<span><img src="/@/assets/folder.svg">docs</span>
- <span><img src="/@/assets/file-html.svg">index.html</span>

<span><img src="/@/assets/file-html.svg">index.html</span>

</div>

### @ Folder Contents

| item        | description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| /assets     | images, icons, and other assets             |
| /components | custom element source code                  |
| /css        | global stylesheets                          |
| build.js    | called by `npm run build` during deployment |
| main.js     | register custom elements here               |
| head.json   | anything that goes in the document head     |

## Pages

Each page should have its own folder containing an index.html file, i.e. `/about/index.html`. Thanks to the power of custom elements, pages can share a layout by assigning a custom element containing the site's layout to the body.

### Minimum page structure

Every page should include the following:

1. A body tag with this `is` attribute assigned to a custom element that contains the page's layout.
2. A script tag loading `/@/main.js`. This loads the custom elemenets required to make the site operate as an SPA.
3. You can write the page in markdown by adding `lang="md"` to the body and writing markdown between the opening and closing body tags. If you use prettier, you'll need to add a `<!--prettier-ignore-->` comment before the body tag.

```html
&lt;body is="app-layout" lang="md"&gt;

# About Ramidus

This site is written in markdown.

<script src="/@/main.js" type="module"></script>

&lt;/body&gt;
```

### Linking to Pages

To enable SPA-style page loading, internal links should be written with the `<spa-link>` element, like this:
```html
<spa-link href="/about">About Us</spa-link>
```

You can also use `<spa-link>` to scroll the page to an element with and ID using a hash link, like this:

```html
<spa-link href="#getting-started">Getting Started</spa-link>
```

## Layouts

A layout is a custom element containing the site's shared markup and a slot for the page content. A layout should include the `<spa-root>` element with a nested `<slot>`. Here is the default layout included with Ramidus. Notice that the layout can contain any number of other components. This example is written with Ardi, but you can write it with any framework (or none).

```js
// /@/components/app-layout.

import ardi, { html } from '//cdn.skypack.dev/ardi'

ardi({
  tag: 'app-layout',
  extends: [HTMLBodyElement, 'body'],
  template() {
    return html`
      <app-nav></app-nav>
      <main>
        <spa-root>
          <slot></slot>
        </spa-root>
      </main>
      <app-footer></app-footer>
    `
  },
})
```

<script src="/@/main.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
