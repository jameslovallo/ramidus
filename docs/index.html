# Ramidus Docs

Ramidus is a SPA framework built for custom elements.

## Getting Started

Setup is easy and no tooling is required. You can scaffold your project using `npx` or simply download [this zip file](https://codeload.github.com/jameslovallo/ramidus/zip/refs/heads/main).

```sh
npx ramidus@latest && npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

The "@" folder contains global content like components, assets, layouts and your site's head. This convention keeps the folder first alphabetically so you don't lose it in your content.

<div class="tree">

- <tree-icon icon="home" label="@"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="assets" label="assets"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="components" label="components"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="css" label="css"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="js" label="build.js"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="js" label="main.js"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="json" label="head.json"></tree-icon>
- <tree-icon icon="folder" label="docs"></tree-icon>
  - <tree-icon icon="html" label="index.html"></tree-icon>
- <tree-icon icon="html" label="index.html"></tree-icon>

</div>

## Pages

Each page must have its own folder containing an index.html file, i.e. `/about/index.html`. Pages can use a shared layout by assigning a custom element to the body (see <spa-link href="#layouts">layouts</spa-link>).

### Writing Pages

Every page must include the following:

1. A body tag with the `is` attribute assigned to a custom element that contains the page's layout.
2. A script tag loading `/@/main.js`. This loads the custom elements required to make the site operate as an SPA.

You can write the page in markdown by adding `lang="md"` to the body and writing markdown between the opening and closing body tags. If you use prettier, you'll need to add a `<!--prettier-ignore-->` comment before the body tag.

```html
<!--prettier-ignore-->
&lt;body is="app-layout" lang="md"&gt;

# About Ramidus

This site is written in markdown.

<script src="/@/main.js" type="module"></script>

&lt;/body&gt;
```

### Linking to Pages

To enable SPA-style page loading, internal links should be handled using the `<spa-link>` element. Clicking a hash link will scroll to the element with the same ID.

```html
<spa-link href="/about">About Us</spa-link>
<spa-link href="#getting-started">Getting Started</spa-link>
```

## Layouts

A layout is a custom element containing the site's shared markup. Layouts should include the `<spa-root>` element with a nested `<slot>` to load the page's content. Here is the default layout included with Ramidus.

```html
<app-nav></app-nav>

<main>
  <spa-root>
    <slot></slot>
  </spa-root>
</main>

<app-footer></app-footer>
```

## Components

Global components live in `/@/components` and are registered in `/@/main.js`. Ramidus's core components are built with [Ardi](ardi.netlify.app), but you can use any custom element framework you like (or none).

## Deployment

No build step is required to deploy this site: you can copy this project to a simple server and it will run just fine as-is. You will probably still want to run `npm run build` before you deploy though.

### Benefits of Building
1. Pages written in markdown are compiled to HTML, resulting in faster [FCP](https://web.dev/fcp/) and [LCP](https://web.dev/lcp/) scores.
1. The site's `head` is included with each page instead of being generated when the first page loads.
2. Building will make it so the first page the user loads is hidden at first, then gracefully fades in after the globally-registered components have loaded, preventing [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/).

### Deploying to Netlify, Vercel or Similar
| Build Command | Publish Directory |
|---|---|
| npm run build | dist |

<script src="/@/main.js" type="module"></script>
