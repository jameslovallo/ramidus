  # Ramidus

  Ramidus is a SPA for the modern web. Built with and for custom elements, Ramidus provides familiar conventions and a *tiny* bit of tooling to provide the best UX and DX possible.

  ## Features

  - Modern app structure, similar to Next, Nuxt or SvelteKit
  - SPA routing using `spa-slot` and `spa-link` elements.
  - Create layouts that are shared across multiple pages.
  - Allow specific pages to reload the app with a `<!--spa-reload-->` comment.
  - Write pages in HTML or GitHub-flavored markdown.
  - 100% vanilla folder structure and routing.
  - No building or tooling required. This project runs right in the browser, though there is an optional build step to make the first page load more gracefully.
  - Nothing is hidden behind the scenes. The source for all core components and the optional build script is included in the project and can be modified to your liking.
