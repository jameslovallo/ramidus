  # Ardi SPA

  Hi there. If you've stumbled on this page, you're probably looking for a
  Single Page Application (SPA) framework that's specifically designed for
  Custom Elements (aka Web Components). Look no further! Ardi SPA is a set a
  of custom elements and a *tiny* bit of optional tooling to provide the best UX and DX possible.

  ## Features

  - Modern app structure, similar to Next, Nuxt or SvelteKit
  - SPA routing using `spa-slot` and `spa-link` elements.
  - Create layouts that are shared across multiple pages.
  - Specify if a page should reload the app using a `<!--spa-reload-->` comment.
  - Write pages in HTML or GitHub-flavored markdown.
  - 100% vanilla folder structure and routing.
  - No building or tooling required. This project runs right in the browser, though there is an optional build step to make the first page load more gracefully.
  - Nothing is hidden behind the scenes. The source for all core components and the optional build script is included in the project and can be modified to your liking.
