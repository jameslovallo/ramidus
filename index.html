  # Ardi SPA

  Hi there. If you've stumbled on this page, you're probably looking for a
  Single Page Application framework (SPA) that's specifically designed for
  Custom Elements (aka Web Components). Look no further! Ardi SPA is a set a
  of custom elements and a *tiny* bit of optional tooling to provide the best UX and DX possible.

  ## Features

  - Familiar, modern app structure, similar to Next, Nuxt or SvelteKit
  - Write pages in markdown or html. This page is written in markdown, actually.
  - SPA routing using `<spa-router>` and `<spa-link>` elements.
  - Specify if a page should reload the app using a `<!--spa-reload-->` comment.
  - No building or tooling required. This project runs right in the browser, though there is an optional build step to make it so the page gracefully fades in after the global components have loaded.
  - Nothing is hidden behind the scenes. The source for all core components and the optional build script is included in the project and can be modified to your liking.
