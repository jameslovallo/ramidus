# Ramidus

Ramidus is a SPA for the modern web. Built with and for custom elements, Ramidus provides familiar conventions and a *tiny* bit of tooling to provide the best UX and DX possible.

## Features

- Familiar app structure, similar to Next or Nuxt
- SPA routing using `spa-slot` and `spa-link` elements.
- Layouts can be shared across multiple pages.
- Write pages in HTML or GitHub-flavored markdown.
- Vanilla folder structure and routing.
- No building or tooling required.

## Getting Started

```sh
npx ramidus@latest && npm run dev
```

<script src="/@/main.js" type="module"></script>
</body>
